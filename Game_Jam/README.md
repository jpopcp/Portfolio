What if I told you that the only thing standing between us and a zombie apocalypse... are llamas? Yes, llamas!
Llamas vs. Zombies is a fast-paced strategy game where llamas use their unique abilities to fend off endless waves of the undead.
Why llamas? Because they are sweet, unique and original animals that ( maybe ) you would never put in front of a zombie , or would you?
Why would people want to play? Addictiveness, humor, creative mechanics, originality, free cosmetics, fun, the element of surprise and learning how to save money in order to defend your life!
Llamas vs. Zombies is the wacky, strategy-packed, and endlessly fun game you didnâ€™t know you needed. Are you ready to spit in the face of danger?
